# The-Odin-Project_Landing-Page_CSS-
This is the Landing Page Project to help demonstrate the "html" and "css' skills have learnt from "The Odin Project" foundation lessons. Not gonna lie, css kicked my ass a bit and made me wonna punch a concrete wall a few times, but with persistence, I started to have fun with Flexbox.
This webpage is not responsive yet. Looking to make it super-duper responsive once i get to that part of the course so don't try to open with your phones so you don't see crazy things lol.  
All Images on this Project are gotten form "unsplash.com". Got some good contents in there. 
Moving on with the course
Also, Credit to "The Odin Project for making the course super easy to follow- you guys rock!
